## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing Machine Learning and Data Analysis techniques using Python and SQL. It provides practical examples and tutorials to demonstrate the application of these concepts to real-world datasets. Additionally, it includes the development of interactive dashboards to visualize and present the analyzed data effectively.

## Prerequisites

To utilize the code and resources in this repository, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- SQL Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Required SQL libraries (e.g., pymysql, psycopg2, sqlite3)

## Project Structure
