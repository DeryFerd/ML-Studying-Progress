## Introduction

This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing Machine Learning and Data Analysis techniques using Python and SQL. It provides practical examples and tutorials to demonstrate the application of these concepts to real-world datasets. Additionally, it includes the development of interactive dashboards to visualize and present the analyzed data effectively.

## Prerequisites

To utilize the code and resources in this repository, you can use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks with Python. This eliminates the need for local installations of Python and other software. The notebooks in this repository can be opened and executed directly on Google Colaboratory.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── datasets/         # Contains sample datasets for analysis
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for different projects and tutorials
├── scripts/          # SQL scripts for database setup and querying
├── dashboards/       # Files related to interactive dashboards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
├── utils/            # Utility functions and modules for data preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.
├── LICENSE           # License file
└── README.md         # Project README file
```

## Installation

Since this project can be run directly on Google Colaboratory, there is no need for local installations of software or libraries.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or directly access it on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Explore the `notebooks/` directory to find various Jupyter notebooks with examples and tutorials on Machine Learning and Data Analysis using Python and SQL.

4. Use the `scripts/` directory to set up your SQL database and execute SQL queries for data retrieval, transformation, and analysis.

5. Check the `dashboards/` directory for files related to interactive dashboards built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Customize the dashboards according to your specific requirements.

6. Modify and enhance the existing code or create new notebooks to further explore and experiment with Machine Learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and visualization methods.
